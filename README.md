# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification
This repository contains the Iris Flower Classification project completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. The project uses machine learning techniques to classify iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements using Python and Scikit-learn.

Iris Flower Classification

About the Project:
   This project is a simple machine learning classification program using the Iris flower dataset.
The goal is to predict the type of iris flower based on its measurements.

The dataset contains three flower species:

•Setosa
•Versicolor
•Virginica

Dataset Used:

•Iris dataset (from scikit-learn)
•Features used
  •Sepal Length
  •Sepal Width
  •Petal Length
  •Petal Width

Tools and Libraries:

•Python
•Pandas
•Seaborn
•Matplotlib
•Scikit-learn

What This Project Does?

•Loads the Iris dataset
•Shows data visualization using pair plot
•Splits data into training and testing sets
•Trains a Logistic Regression model
•Tests the model accuracy
•Predicts flower species for given input

Model Used:

•Logistic Regression
•Used for classifying three different flower species

Output:

•Displays accuracy of the model
•Shows classification report
•Predicts species for a sample flower

Example:

Input: [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]
Output: Setosa

How to Run:

1.Install required libraries:
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn


2.Run the Python file:
python iris_classification.py

Purpose:
This project is done for learning basic machine learning concepts and data visualization.
